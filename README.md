## Features

- **Create Custom AI Contacts**: Personalize your AI contacts by giving them a name and defining their characteristics. The more detailed you are, the better their responses will be.
- **Powered by LLama 3.1 Lexi**: text.ai leverages the LLM model [LLama 3.1 Lexi](https://huggingface.co/Orenguteng/Llama-3.1-8B-Lexi-Uncensored-V2-GGUF) to deliver human-like responses.
- **Unique Contact Images**: Generate contact images using the [PerfectDeliberate Anime](https://civitai.com/models/111274/perfectdeliberate-anime) model. The AI generates images based on the characteristics you provide, ensuring a personalized touch.
- **User Privacy**: All images are visible only to you. Please provide appropriate characteristics, as inappropriate content will be removed, and accounts may be banned.
